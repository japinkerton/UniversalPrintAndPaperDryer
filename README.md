# UniversalPrintAndPaperDryer
Drying rack can be used to dry both inkjet and darkroom photo prints (or any paper that fits in it).

This build consists of:
- 2 x Sides
- 4 x Base Brackets

NOTE: Some slicers, such as OrcaSlicer have performance issues when slicing sides with larger slot counts.  You should have no problems when using Cura.
